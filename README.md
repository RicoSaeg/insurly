# insurly app


This streamlit app allows the user gain information on a patient dataset. He can also make adjustment and specify his analysis. The user can also upload his own patient data in order to predict the likeliness of a heart disease on the dataset. The instances are automatically put into categories according to their likeliness of a heart disease. The chosen model was a XGBClassifier with hyperparametertuning.

This repo includes also the jupyter notebook in which the data has beend handled and transformed as well as the different models trained.
